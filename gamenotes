Enemy patterns
--------------
Have slow moving enemies that stop and shot out a ring of bullets then leave the screen
Two columns of enemy either side of the screen shooting homing bullets at you
Start a pattern off and then make it home in on the player's position. 


General notes
-------------
You don't always need a lot of bullets on the screen, barrages of enemies are common
