EASY
--------------
Draw score etc on the panel
Linear shot that slows down (but limit end point so it doesnt reverse)
Make lines of shots (super easy)
Make homing shots point towards direction
Make more EnemyFactory patterns
Make RegularMobs have the possibility to shoot
Move all sprites over to Taisei sprites to avoid getting sued


DIFFICULT
--------------
Currently hit detection is only for circles, what if you want to implement different shapes?
times to do a pattern?
Watch more Shiffman videos etc to find more cool mathematical shapes to put in
Revise what the hell "k" etc means in a spiral
Find out how to do a "whip" style pattern
Homing bullets are still fucked

FOR LATER
-------------
checkBounds mixin takes the entire bullet object as an argument. It'd be much better to specifically pass in its dimensions and its position (which is only what you need to check)
also you could make checkBounds part of the Game class. It makes little sense to use it for Player

DONE
--------------
Make RegularMob movement patterns and implement them on initialization
Make a shot go to a certain position (tween) and then explode into a ring
Resize window to be more like touhou
Make a general shot class and put the subclasses (SimpleSideShot etc) into their own files under a shots folder.. you're going to be making a lot of thes e
Linear shot that targets player position
Make enemies come up from behind
Do a perfect ring with gaps in it
Sort out variabe names for patterns, what does "amount" mean? The amount of bullets? The max number of
Make focus mode focus all your bullets on one direction
