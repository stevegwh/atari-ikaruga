Concept: 


Much like the Dreamcast game "Ikaruga" you have two states: Red and Blue.


Enemies in the game are also red and blue


While you are blue/red the corresponding bullets do not hurt you, rather they fill the corresponding color's meter.


In addition to this you deal double damage to enemies of the opposite color.


Once both the blue and red gauges have been filled you become purple for a limited time where you are invincible and deal double damage to all enemies.


Controls: Move-> WSAD, Fire -> Space, Change color: Q.


How to install:

Clone repo

Install love2d from: https://love2d.org/

On linux: love <path to atari-ikaruga>


Uncomment lines from leveldata in order to showcase more enemies.
